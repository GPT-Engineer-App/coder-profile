# coder-profile

A personal website for a programmer. The site should highlight the programmer's skills, projects, and experience. It should have a clean, modern design with sections for About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The color scheme should be sleek, using shades of blue and gray, with a minimalist layout to keep the focus on the content.
